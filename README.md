# signature

In order to use the same template start the parcel server
```sh
yarn
yarn parcel index.html
```
and replace my data with yours or experiment with the layout a bit more. 

Once happy with the results, convert to word-doc-like format [here](https://html-online.com/editor/), 
in the open source text editor. Copy the document created, paste into gmail or outlook and voila!

The fonts and colors can be adjusted during adding of the signature in the email settings, 
as well as during editing in the online editor.

This is what I settled with:
